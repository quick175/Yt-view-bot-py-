this program requires yt-dlp.exe which is NOT my program and you can download it from https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
For this version you have to change the urls yourself
It works by opening and closing tabs any amount of times you like
it reads the duration of the file (eg. 3mins) and waits for exactly 3 mins to close the tabs  then open them again
